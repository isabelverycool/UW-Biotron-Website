                      <p>
                        At EMG Fabric, we design and produce reusable, dry metal electrodes that work seamlessly with advanced machine learning libraries to interpret EMG signals. Our mission is to create a versatile suite of EMG electrodes and accompanying software to empower assisted-mobility applications, such as exoskeletons for patients with muscular dystrophies and supporting other pro-bono initiatives. We aim to revolutionize how EMG data is harnessed to improve patient outcomes.

                      <p>
                        We are pioneering software development for Spine Biostickers, a tool designed to monitor spinal posture in post-surgical patients, helping to prevent harmful movements during recovery. By utilizing gyroscopes attached to the patient, our system collects data and provides real-time alerts, ensuring patients maintain safe postures and facilitating a smoother, safer recovery process.
